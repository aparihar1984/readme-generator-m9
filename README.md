Module 9 Challenge - Creating a README Generator!

## Introduction
For this assignment, I built a README Generator application that allows users to generate a README.md file by answering questions including what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.  The README Generator features inquirer@8.2.4 inside Node.js which is powered by JavaScript.

## Criteria
To meet the Accepted Criteria of this assignment, I created a README Generator using Node.js that features the following:

When the user is prompted for information about their application repository, a professional README.md is generated with the title of the project along with numerous other sections.

When the user enters the project title, this title is displayed as the title of the README.

When the user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributors, and Tests.

When the user chooses a license for the application from a list of options, them a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

When the user enters their GitHub username, then this is added to the README with a link to their GitHub profile.

When the user enters their email address, then this is added to the README with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

## References
To complete this assignment I studied the following activities from the Module 9-NodeJS Class Files as references:

"03-Ins_Arrow-Function" 

"13-Ins_Read-Write-File" 

"28-Stu_Mini-Project"

After this, I searched the internet for further information and came across the following websites as references:

"https://github.com/mjgiannelli/professional-README-generator"

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD0CSJbL1lU"

"https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/readme-generator-pqdls5?file=%2Findex.js"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities and websites mentioned above and commenting out every section of code in both the index.js and generateMarkdown.js files to see what each specific block of code accomplished.

This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed to ultimately complete as much of the Accepted Criteria as possible.

The experimentation was necessary since it should be pointed out that while the code given inside the above referenced websites was very helpful, the code given DOES NOT completely accomplish everything that was asked for in the Acceptance Criteria for our specific assignment. It should also be noted that simply copying and pasting code without understanding what that code does will lead to more complications and a lack of understanding.
